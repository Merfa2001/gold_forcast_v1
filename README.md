![Screenshot from 2025-01-23 11-06-03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a27b5138-4dba-4957-9503-1e5c0dc992b6)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to predict future gold prices using various machine learning and data preprocessing techniques. The project focuses on analyzing historical data to forecast features such as High, Low, Open, and Close prices for gold.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes key trends and patterns in the dataset.
- **Model Training:** Implements machine learning models to forecast gold prices.
- **Evaluation:** Measures the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gold-price-forecast.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gold-price-forecast
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook gold_asli__finaalll.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.
